Teta is meant to become a Text Adventure at some point in the future
that uses an Internal Domain Specific Language to describe the game
data. Learning Ruby by Doing.

It uses:
  * ruby-sdl-ffi to play musicV
  * rb-readline for the command history
  * rspec for testing
  * ocra to create the stand-alone Windows executeable
  * metric_fu to capture various code quality metrics
  * simplecov to calculate spec coverage
